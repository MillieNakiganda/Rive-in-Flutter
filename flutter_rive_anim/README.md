# flutter_rive_anim

Flutter animations with Rive using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td3xEWwRAQA&t=606s)

## Getting Started

[Rive](https://docs.rive.app/rive/core-concepts) is a tool that helps designers come up with complex animations that will later be imported into a project.

Since we are to import the rive generated animation in flutter, check out the [Flutter runtime for Rive](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter)

To manage the flutter animations in our flutter project, we shall have to install the rive dependency: flutter pub add rive.

We are to use svg images too, so we have to install the flutter svg pacakage: flutter pub add flutter_svg
